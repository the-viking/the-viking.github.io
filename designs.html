<h3>CS 101:</h3>

<p>
If you’ve never programmed before, chances are you have very little idea of how it works, or what you can really learn to do with it.</p> 

<p>
To make the idea of taking a CS class more appealing to people without much exposure to the field, in CS 101 we’ll co-learn another skill that is more appealing to both genders: photography. 

<p>
Photography is explicitly creative, and it’s much more likely that students have experience with it and would be less intimidated by the thought of taking a class about it than programming. It also lends itself extremely well to computational manipulations- a photo is just a big 3D array of numbers.  It’s immediately obvious that you can take this class and learn to make cool stuff and take better pictures.  Students could work up from learning how to rename the files from the command line to building a photo-editing tool with a GUI that lets them add filters a la Instagram. Many photo manipulations are somewhat simple conceptually, so this is all something people can explain to their friends and siblings who might also be interested in what they can make using programming.

<h3>Github:</h3>

<p>
There are tons of resources for people who are just learning to code. There are also a lot of finished products and open source tools and libraries that more advanced coders have created. What is harder to find are the resources that get you from the more basic projects to really useful, interesting programs. 
</p>

<p>
One thing that could fill in the gap would be a site that’s a repository not of specific questions or of finished products, but of skills and recipes for doing something in code. This would be a browsable archive of pseudocode or code snippets explaining how to do specific things, like how to store objects in Python for later using cPickle. Users could store useful recipes in their recipe box. When they want to start a project, they check off all the recipes they think they’ll need  and there could be a requirements management feature so they could in one click make sure they have all the necessary libraries to use the recipes they’re interested in. They would download a stub file with all the import statements in place, and attributions to the authors of the recipes they’re using. This acknowledges the support that beginning and intermediate coders all use when they’re starting out and allows people who today author tutorials to see more directly how their snippets and skills are being used by other people.

<h3>Insensitivity Training:</h3>
<p>
Working in academia and also in the tech industry means that what you do is more visible than it would be in other professions, which can make people feel vulnerable. Open discussion and critique of others’ work is integral to progress in the field, but we can teach people how to put criticism and praise in perspective, and how to share their opinions about others’ work in really constructive ways. 
</p>
<p>
To start off with, we can give examples about negative things that people said about highly successful companies and products in their early days (For example, a blogger said about the first iPad: “Anyone who believes this thing is a game-changer is a tool”). You can teach people to see through logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks and general negativity to where the root of the criticism lies, so they can address that in future development instead of remaining stuck on the hurtful statements people say. There could be talks from successful industry professionals about imposter syndrome, how it’s affected their career and what they’ve done to overcome it. Then it could teach people best practices for evaluating others’ work, and the most helpful ways to do so.

<h3>Technical Interviews:</h3>

<p>
Many technical interviews focus on clever algorithm tricks and writing code without a computer. For most software engineering jobs, this doesn’t accurately test the skills that people use most in practice: reading and understanding other people’s code, debugging and refactoring code to meet changing requirements, and actual implementation of useful features and programs. This means that great software engineers that get nervous in interviews or struggle with whiteboard coding don’t get a chance to show that they really shine where it matters. A more comprehensive interview that focuses more on concrete skills and realistic scenarios could keep those people from slipping between the cracks. 
</p>

<p>
The interview would start with a module of code in the interviewee’s choice of language, on their own computer. It could be written poorly, have bugs, lack documentation, have confusing variable names or other issues with it, and the interviewee could be given time to fix as many of these issues as they can, and then discuss the changes they made and how they prioritized and made design decisions. Next, interviewers would ask the interviewee to implement another method in the module, and see how they can follow specifications and coding style. Finally, they would ask the interviewee to come up with a program of their own that utilized the module in some way. A really open-ended question like this could really demonstrate creativity and ingenuity, as well as how they approach writing totally new code and programs.

<h3>By(standards):</h3>

<p>
Minority issues can’t always be solved by minorities. Without the support of more members of the tech community, marginalized groups will have a much more daunting task ahead of them if they want to feel well-represented and respected in their chosen profession. Too often, however, these issues play out in an antagonistic way, with majority members feeling defensive and finding any fault they possibly can with the (human and imperfect) methods that minority groups use to promote their advancement. Sexism, racism, heterosexism and other biases now are much more concretely stored in attitudes and group behaviors than in laws and policies, so a top-down approach is unlikely to be effective. Focusing on mutual benefit and the ways that majority groups can be an ally and advocate for the cause of equality is a surer way to make that goal a part of the culture of technology work. 
</p>

<p>
An effective social movement dedicated to promoting a more fair and welcoming community would focus first on education about why these issues matter. The tech community is not known for accepting equality of representation as a virtuous goal in and of itself, so this would need to focus on how a truly inclusive culture would make the tech world better for all of its participants. The fact that discrimination still exists is also debated, so studies such as those judging resumes that show that women with the same credentials are judged as less competent than men would be an important component, as well as examples of treatment of minorities in tech culture that are stereotypical.
</p>

<p>
But education in this sense is more likely to affect a viewpoint than a set of behaviors, which is what really needs to change to promote inclusivity. To achieve that, we would create a pledge of community standards for members of minority groups and their allies to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Advocate for one another’s success and opportunities. Self-advocacy is promoted in the business world, but it is more difficult for minority members to do so and they may be judged more harshly for it than majority members.</li>

<li>Remove sexist/racist/discriminatory language from your life. Not only from your own speech, but to show others that you don’t find it acceptable when they use it either.</li>


<li>Refuse to be a bystander when a situation arises that makes someone feel uncomfortable or not included because of one of these characteristics. This is the most difficult part to do with tact and grace because it often doesn’t feel appropriate to get involved with what can feel like someone else’s issue, but it’s more important that no one should feel alone and unsupported.</li>
</ul>

<p>
        Companies could promote this amongst their employees and if a large enough promotion of the organization chooses to be a member, they could use the seal of the organization on their site as a sign to potential employees that inclusivity is a value that they hold strongly.
